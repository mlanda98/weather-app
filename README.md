# weather-app

A dynamic weather forecast web app built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can search for the current weather in any city and toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The app fetches real-time weather data using the **Visual Crossing Weather API**, and updates the UI based on weather conditions with optional use of weather-related GIFs from the Giphy API.
